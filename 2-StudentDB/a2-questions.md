## Assignment 2 Questions

#### Directions
Please answer the following questions and submit in your repo for the second assignment.  Please keep the answers as short and concise as possible.

1. In this assignment I asked you provide an implementation for the `get_student(...)` function because I think it improves the overall design of the database application.   After you implemented your solution do you agree that externalizing `get_student(...)` into it's own function is a good design strategy?  Briefly describe why or why not.

    > **Answer**:  Yes, it is a good design strategy. It promotes code reusability and modularity, making the code easier to maintain and understand. By having a dedicated function for retrieving student records, we avoid code duplication and ensure that any changes to the retrieval logic need to be made in only one place.

2. Another interesting aspect of the `get_student(...)` function is how its function prototype requires the caller to provide the storage for the `student_t` structure:

    ```c
    int get_student(int fd, int id, student_t *s);
    ```

    Notice that the last parameter is a pointer to storage **provided by the caller** to be used by this function to populate information about the desired student that is queried from the database file. This is a common convention (called pass-by-reference) in the `C` programming language. 

    In other programming languages an approach like the one shown below would be more idiomatic for creating a function like `get_student()` (specifically the storage is provided by the `get_student(...)` function itself):

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t student;
        bool student_found = false;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found)
            return &student;
        else
            return NULL;
    }
    ```
    Can you think of any reason why the above implementation would be a **very bad idea** using the C programming language?  Specifically, address why the above code introduces a subtle bug that could be hard to identify at runtime? 

    > **ANSWER:** Returning a pointer to a local (stack) variable is a very bad idea in C because the local variable’s lifetime ends when the function returns. If you return the address of such a variable, that memory can be overwritten by subsequent function calls or other operations, leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or bugs that are hard to trace. So, using pass-by-reference is much safer.

3. Another way the `get_student(...)` function could be implemented is as follows:

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND or memory allocation error: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t *pstudent;
        bool student_found = false;

        pstudent = malloc(sizeof(student_t));
        if (pstudent == NULL)
            return NULL;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found){
            return pstudent;
        }
        else {
            free(pstudent);
            return NULL;
        }
    }
    ```
    In this implementation the storage for the student record is allocated on the heap using `malloc()` and passed back to the caller when the function returns. What do you think about this alternative implementation of `get_student(...)`?  Address in your answer why it work work, but also think about any potential problems it could cause.  
    
    > **ANSWER:** This implementation works because it allocates the student record on the heap, ensuring that the memory remains valid after the function returns. However, it introduces potential problems such as memory leaks, since the caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory and may forget to do so; error handling complexity, because every caller must check for a NULL return and manage the allocated memory, which can lead to inconsistent error handling across the codebase; and performance overhead, as frequent dynamic memory allocations can be slower and may fragment the heap if many student records are retrieved.


4. Lets take a look at how storage is managed for our simple database. Recall that all student records are stored on disk using the layout of the `student_t` structure (which has a size of 64 bytes).  Lets start with a fresh database by deleting the `student.db` file using the command `rm ./student.db`.  Now that we have an empty database lets add a few students and see what is happening under the covers.  Consider the following sequence of commands:

    ```bash
    > ./sdbsc -a 1 john doe 345
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 128 Jan 17 10:01 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 3 jane doe 390
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 256 Jan 17 10:02 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 63 jim doe 285 
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 64 janet doe 310
    > du -h ./student.db
        8.0K    ./student.db
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 4160 Jan 17 10:03 ./student.db
    ```

    For this question I am asking you to perform some online research to investigate why there is a difference between the size of the file reported by the `ls` command and the actual storage used on the disk reported by the `du` command.  Understanding why this happens by design is important since all good systems programmers need to understand things like how linux creates sparse files, and how linux physically stores data on disk using fixed block sizes.  Some good google searches to get you started: _"lseek syscall holes and sparse files"_, and _"linux file system blocks"_.  After you do some research please answer the following:

    - Please explain why the file size reported by the `ls` command was 128 bytes after adding student with ID=1, 256 after adding student with ID=3, and 4160 after adding the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** The ls command reports the logical file size, which is determined by the highest byte written. Each student record occupies 64 bytes and is written at an offset equal to ID × 64. For example, when a student with ID=1 is added, the record is written at offset 64, so the file size becomes 64 (offset) + 64 (record size) = 128 bytes. Similarly, student with ID=3 is written at offset 192, making the file size 192 + 64 = 256 bytes; and for student with ID=64, the record is written at offset 4096, so the file size becomes 4096 + 64 = 4160 bytes.

    -   Why did the total storage used on the disk remain unchanged when we added the student with ID=1, ID=3, and ID=63, but increased from 4K to 8K when we added the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** The du command shows the actual disk space used, which depends on how the file system allocates physical blocks (typically 4K blocks). When students with lower IDs are added, even though the logical file size increases, the unwritten gaps (which are all zeros) do not cause new disk blocks to be allocated because the file is stored as a sparse file. However, when the student with ID=64 is added, the write occurs in a block that wasn’t previously allocated, causing the file system to allocate a new 4K block and increasing the physical storage from 4K to 8K.

    - Now lets add one more student with a large student ID number  and see what happens:

        ```bash
        > ./sdbsc -a 99999 big dude 205 
        > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 6400000 Jan 17 10:28 ./student.db
        > du -h ./student.db
        12K     ./student.db
        ```
        We see from above adding a student with a very large student ID (ID=99999) increased the file size to 6400000 as shown by `ls` but the raw storage only increased to 12K as reported by `du`.  Can provide some insight into why this happened?

        > **ANSWER:**  Adding a student with a very large ID (such as 99999) causes the logical file size to jump to 6,400,000 bytes because the record is written at a very high offset (ID × 64). However, since the file is sparse, the file system does not allocate physical disk blocks for the unwritten areas (holes) that remain all zeros. As a result, even though ls shows a large file size, the actual disk space used (as reported by du) increases only slightly—to cover the new blocks that were explicitly written—resulting in only a few additional kilobytes of physical storage.
